# Manifest Generator

The manifest generator allows to quickly generate Kubernetes manifests.

## Basic usage

The generator is expecting components to be defined under the `parameters.components` path of the inventory.

For instance, create a component `echo-server`, simply create the following section:

```yaml
parameters:
  components:
    echo-server:
      image: jmalloc/echo-server
```

Compiling, `kapitan` will generate a simple deployment with the above image.

## Defining default values

Sometimes, when defining many components, you and up repeating many repeating configurations.
With this generator, you can define defaults in 2 ways:

### Global Generator Defaults
The [global defaults](../../../inventory/classes/kapitan/generators/manifests.yml) can be used to set defaults for every component being generated.

As you can see, some defaults are already set:
```yaml
  generators:
    manifest:
      default_config:
        type: deployment
        annotations:
          "manifests.kapicorp.com/generated": true
```

You do not have to change that class directly, as long as you add to the same inventory structure for another class.

For instance, when we enable the [`features.tesoro`](../../../inventory/classes/features/tesoro.yml) class, we can see that we are adding the following yaml fragment:

```yaml
  generators:
    manifest:
      default_config:
        globals:
          secrets:
            labels: 
              tesoro.kapicorp.com: enabled
```

Which has the effect to add the `tesoro.kapicorp.com: enabled` label to every generated configMap resource.

### Application defaults
You can also create application defaults, where an application is a class/profile that can be associated to multiple components.

For instance, let's assume you have the following definition for an application class called `microservices`

```yaml
parameters:
  applications:
    microservices:
      component_defaults:
        replicas: 3
        env:
          KAPITAN_APPLICATION: microservices
```

Every component that belongs to that application class will receive the defaults for the application.
To associate a component to an application, use the `application` directive.

```yaml
parameters:
  components:
    echo-server:
      application: microservices
      image: jmalloc/echo-server
```

Compiling, kapitan will generate a *deployment* with image `jmalloc/echo-server`, 3 replicas, an annotation and an env variable.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    manifests.kapicorp.com/generated: 'true'
  labels:
    app: echo-server
  name: echo-server
  namespace: tutorial
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: echo-server
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: echo-server
    spec:
      containers:
        - env:
            - name: KAPITAN_APPLICATION
              value: microservices
          image: jmalloc/echo-server
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          name: echo-server
      restartPolicy: Always
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
```

## Ports and Services

### Defining ports
You can define the ports your component uses by adding them under the `ports` directive:

```yaml
parameters:
  components:
    echo-server:
      <other config>
      ports:
        http:
          container_port: 8080
```

The above will produce the following effect:

```diff
--- a/compiled/echo-server/manifests/echo-server-bundle.yml
+++ b/compiled/echo-server/manifests/echo-server-bundle.yml

+            - containerPort: 8080
+              name: http
+              protocol: TCP

```

### Exposing a service
If you want to expose the service, add the `service` directive with the desired service `type`, and define the `service_port`:

```yaml
parameters:
  components:
    echo-server:
      <other config>
      ports:
        http:
          service_port: 80
          container_port: 8080
```

Which will create a service manifest with the same name as the component, and will produce the following effect:
```diff

Omitting the `service_port` directive will tell the generator not to expose that port as a service.

### Liveness and Readiness checks
You can also quickly add a `readiness`/`liveness` check:

```yaml
parameters:
  components:
    echo-server:
      <other config>
      healthcheck:
        readiness:
          type: http
          port: http

```

## Config Maps

Creating both `secrets` and `config maps` is very simple with Kapitan Generators, and the interface is very similar with minor differences between them.

### Simple config map

```yaml
      config_maps:
        config:
          data:
            echo-service.conf: 
              value: |-
                # A configuration file
                example: true
```

A configMap manifest was created. The name is taken from the component.

```yaml
cat compiled/tutorial/manifests/echo-server-config.yml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  echo-service.conf: '# A configuration file

    example: true'
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    name: echo-server
  name: echo-server
  namespace: tutorial
```

### Mounting a config map
Note that in the previous example the config map is not mounted, because the `mount` directive is missing.

```yaml
      config_maps:
        config:
          mount: /opt/echo-service
          data:
            echo-service.conf: 
              value: |-
                # A configuration file
                example: true
```

Simply adding the above configuration, will immediately configure the component to mount the config map we have just defined:

```diff
+          volumeMounts:
+            - mountPath: /opt/echo-service
+              name: config
+              readOnly: true
       restartPolicy: Always
       terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
+      volumes:
+        - configMap:
+            defaultMode: 420
+            name: echo-server
+          name: config
```

### Templated config
A more advanced way to create the configuration file, is to use an external `jinja` file as source:

```yaml
      config_maps:
        config:
          mount: /opt/echo-service
          data:
            echo-service.conf:
              template: 'components/echo-server/echo-server.conf.j2'
              values:
                example: true
```

with the file [echo-server.conf.j2](../../../components/echo-server/echo-server.conf.j2) being a jinja template file. 

As expected, we can inject any value from the inventory into the the file.

### Filtering files to mount

We do not always expect to mount all files available in a config map. Sometimes in the config map we have a mix of files and other values destined to be consumed by environment variables instead.

For instance, given the following setup, we can restrict the mount only to files defined in the `items` directive:

```yaml
      config_maps:
        config:
          mount: /opt/echo-service
          items:
            - echo-service.conf
          data:
            echo-service.conf:
              template: 'components/echo-server/echo-server.conf.j2'
              values:
                example: true
            simple_config:
              value: "not mounted"
```

the diff shows that the generator makes use of the items directive in the manifest:

+                path: echo-service.conf
             name: echo-server
```

## Secrets

What discussed with Config Maps also applies to Secrets.
However, in the case of secrets, we have a coupld of extra features:

### Auto base64 encode

We can automatically base64 encode secrets that are not already encoded:
```yaml
      secrets:
        secret:
          data:
            encoded_secret:
              value: my_secret
              b64_encode: true
```

```yaml
cat compiled/tutorial/manifests/echo-server-secret.yml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  encoded_secret: bXlfc2VjcmV0    # ENCODED my_secret
kind: Secret
metadata:
  labels:
    name: echo-server
  name: echo-server
  namespace: tutorial
type: Opaque

```
Note that, because the mount directive is missing, the secret will not be mounted automatically.

Please review the generic way of Kapitan to manage secrets at [https://kapitan.dev/secrets/](https://kapitan.dev/secrets/) and [Secrets management with Kapitan](https://medium.com/kapitan-blog/secrets-management-with-kapitan-47a0476bab10)

In summary, remember that you can summon the power of Google KMS (once setup) and use kapitan secrets like this:

```yaml
      secrets:
        secret:
          data:
            encoded_secret:
              value: my_secret
              b64_encode: true
            better_secret:
              value: ?{gkms:targets/${target_name}/password||randomstr|base64}
```

which will generate an truly encrypted secret using Google KMS (other backends also available)

## Additional containers

You can instruct the generator to add one or more additional containers to your definition:

```yaml
parameters:
  components:
    echo-server:
      <other config>
      # Additional containers
      additional_containers:
        nginx:
          image: nginx
          ports:
            nginx: 
              service_port: 80
```

You can access the same config_maps and secrets as the main container, but you can override mountpoints and subPaths

For instance while this is defined in the outer "main" container scope, we can still mount the nginx config file:
```yaml
parameters:
  components:
    echo-server:
      <other config>
      # Additional containers
      additional_containers:
        nginx:
          image: nginx
          ports:
            nginx: 
              service_port: 80
          config_maps:
            config:
              mount: /etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx.conf
              subPath: nginx.conf

      <other config>
      config_maps:
        config:
          mount: /opt/echo-service/echo-service.conf
          subPath: echo-service.conf
          data:
            echo-service.conf:
              template: "components/echo-server/echo-server.conf.j2"
              values:
                example: true
            nginx.conf:
              value: |
                server {
                   listen       80;
                   server_name  localhost;
                   location / {
                       proxy_pass  http://localhost:8080/;
                   }
                   error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
                   location = /50x.html {
                       root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
                   }
                }
```

## Network Policies

You can also generate Network Policies by simply adding them under the `network_policies` structure.

```yaml
      # One or many network policies
      network_policies:
        default:
          pod_selector: 
            name: echo-server
          ingress:
            - from:
              - podSelector:
                  matchLabels:
                    role: frontend
              ports:
              - protocol: TCP
                port: 6379
```

Which will automatically generate the NetworkPolicy resource
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  labels:
    name: echo-server
  name: echo-server
spec:
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              role: frontend
      ports:
        - port: 6379
          protocol: TCP
  podSelector:
    name: echo-server
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
```
